# Forecast
Forecast is a basic lightweight framework available for Python and JavaScript, intended to make application development easier. 
Forecast includes a module loader, colored logging system, and a console command system (JS only).

## Requirements
Forecast (JS) requires Node.js v4.9.1 or later, and Windows XP or later versions. **It's important to note that some Forecast modules may not work on older versions of Node.js.** 

Forecast (Python) is untested on older Python versions, but is created on v3.11.4. Python testing for Forecast will commence just before Python's official release.

## Where to Begin
It's simple! 
1. Download `index.js` or `index.py`.
2. Run it using `node index.js`, or `python index.py` to allow it to create a modules folder - or create `./modules/` in the same folder as `index.js` or `index.py` manually.
3. Create a `*.js` or `*.py` file within `./modules.`.
4. Program in the file! (you can even create multiple for modular programs!)

## Disclaimer
Forecast for Python is in very early testing, and it is currently not easy to import functions from `index.py`. This is a problem that will be fixed before official release.
